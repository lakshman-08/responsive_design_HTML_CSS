This project focuses on the development of a responsive web design implemented using HTML and CSS. The primary objective was to create a user-friendly interface that adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices, ensuring optimal user experience. The design layout adjusts dynamically using techniques such as media queries, flexible grid systems, and fluid images to maintain consistency and usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

In addition to achieving responsiveness, the project strictly adheres to best coding practices, including semantic HTML, modular and reusable CSS, proper file structuring, and clear documentation. These practices not only enhance readability and maintainability of the code but also facilitate future scalability and collaboration. The result is a clean, efficient, and accessible web design that aligns with modern web development standards.
